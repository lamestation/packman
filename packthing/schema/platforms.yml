                    Run help2man to generate man pages for the listed executables
                    in this project. Requires help2man to be installed on the system.

                        help2man:
                            - propelleride
                            - propman
                            - openspin

                    !!! caution Use only if your application supports the `--help`
                        command line switch.
                        
                        `help2man` expects your executable to have a `--help` option that
                        immediately quits the application after. If your application does not
                        quit, this feature will hang Packthing.
