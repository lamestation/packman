# Target modules

This directory contains implementations for packaging the build output
for different platforms.

All targets should be wrapped in `<target>` tags.

```xml
  <target>
    ...
    ...
  </target>
```

## Existing Targets

### `<deb>`

The `<deb>` tag currently supports the following attributes: `depends`, `categories`, and `section`.

```xml
    <deb depends="libftdi1"
      categories="Development;IDE"
      section="Applications/Programming"
      />
```

 * `depends` - Specify additional dependencies that won't be detected automatically.
 * `categories` - Specify the menu under which your application should appear. Multiple entries should be separated with a semi-colon (`;`). See the [freedesktop.org menu spec](http://standards.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/latest/apa.html) for more information.
 * `section` - Specify the menu under which your application should appear. Multiple entries should be separated with a semi-colon (`;`). See the [freedesktop.org menu spec](http://standards.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/latest/apa.html) for more information.

### `win`

The AppID will be generated by hashing the application URL specified in the `<info>` tag.

### `mac`

### `rpi`

## Defining new targets

The first step to creating your own target is redefining
`self.EXT` and `self.DIR_OUT`. `self.EXT` is the name
of the extension the file output will have. `self.DIR_OUT`
is the root directory of the final target package.

```python
self.EXT = 'deb'
self.DIR_OUT = os.path.join(self.DIR_DEBIAN,'tmp')
```

Next, you need to populate the `self.OUT` dictionary.
There are several pre-defined locations to define; these
are: `'bin'`, `'lib'`, and `'share'`. On a UNIX, these
might be defined as:

```python
self.OUT['bin']   = os.path.join('usr','bin')
self.OUT['lib']   = os.path.join('usr','lib')
self.OUT['share'] = os.path.join('usr','share','yourproject')
```

### `make()` and `finish()`

These functions are called by `packman`.

### The icons() function

This function will define how to handle/populate icons for different platforms.
